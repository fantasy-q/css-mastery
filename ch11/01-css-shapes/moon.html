        <p>The Moon (in Greek: σελήνη Selene, in Latin: Luna) is Earth's only natural satellite. It is one of the
          largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites, the largest relative to the
          size of the planet it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities
          are known (after Jupiter’s satellite Io).
        <p>The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are
          several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the
          debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>
