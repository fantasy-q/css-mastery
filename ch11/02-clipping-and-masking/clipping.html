        <p>The Moon (in Greek: σελήνη Selene, in Latin: Luna) is Earth's only natural satellite. It is one of the
          largest
          natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites, the largest relative to the size of
          the
          planet it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known
          (after
          Jupiter’s satellite Io).

        <p>The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are
          several
          hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left
          over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>

              <p>The Sun (in Greek: Helios, in Latin: Sol) is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far the most
                important source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, with internal
                convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. Its diameter is about 109 times that of
                Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the
                Solar System.</p>
        
              <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and it is informally referred to as a
                yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.567 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a
                region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into
                an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became increasingly hot and dense, eventually
                initiating nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</p>
